# SnakesNLadders
This is a basic and scalable project made with Unity 2018.3.

The objective of the project was to recreate a simple version of the game Snakes & Ladders.
Though the art is and UI is quite basic, the mechanichs are solid and can be heavily modified pretty easily through the many classes.
However, in order to make changes like add more players, change the board size or the number and frequency of ladders and snakes, the scriptable objects that already exist should suffice for such purpose.

The dice 3d model and texture was downloaded as a free asset from the asset store. (Dice Pack Light by WyrmTale Games)

This is a personal project with no intention to be monetized.
